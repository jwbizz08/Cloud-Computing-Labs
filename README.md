# Cloud-Computing-Labs

Welcome to my cloud computing lab repository for cybersecurity. These labs demonstrate my ability to deploy, secure, and manage cloud infrastructure using AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. I focus on setting up virtual machines, configuring networks, and implementing secure storage solutions while adhering to best practices like IAM, encryption, and firewall rules to safeguard cloud resources. Additionally, I conduct penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities and implement effective incident response strategies for mitigating breaches and ensuring rapid recovery. Each lab includes detailed documentation on objectives, methodologies, tools, and outcomes, highlighting my commitment to compliance and proficiency in automating deployment tasks. Explore these labs to see how I integrate robust security measures into scalable cloud environments. This collection does not encompass all of my projects, as I continually add new ones to experiment with and learn from.
